Column - Standard fire with reduced cross section method

    Args:
        F: Vertical load for the beam to support (Calculated as a centrally placed load, also in the case when the column's center of gravity moves)
        Str: Strength class for the wood
        Sup: Support conditions for the column
        ToW: Type of Wood; Sawn, Planed or Glulam (Glued laminated timber)
        WS: Wood Species
        t: Time of exposure
        SEF: Sides Exposed to Fire
    Returns:
        NRc,fire: Charateristic resistance of the column after fire
        Width: Width of the cross section before fire
        Height: Height of the cross section before fire
        Geo: 3D model of the cross section
